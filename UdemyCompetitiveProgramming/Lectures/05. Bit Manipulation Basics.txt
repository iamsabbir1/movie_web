001. Bitwise Operators
    -Bit-manipulation Techniques
    -algorithm to modify data at their binary representation level

    -Bitwise operator 
        -operation on binary representaion data we have
        -how to use this bitwise operator
        -what are the different types of operator
        -how twe can use them to sovle this problem
        -reason why we use bitwise operator 
            bcz they operate binary representaion of the data
            they are fast , compare to non-bitwise operator

        -types of operator
            6 types

        -not operator
            most significant bit is signed bit
        
            int a = 0;
            cout << ~(a);

            it will print -1, but why?

            0 = 00000000
              = 11111111
                      
              = 10000000
                      +1
            magnitude -

            where zero is an integer it's invert is -1

002 Left Shift & Right Shift
    Both left shift and right shift clear


004 Get ith Bit
    get ith bit
    set ith bit
    clear ith bit

005 clear ith bit
